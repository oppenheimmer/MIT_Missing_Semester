# The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

# Motivation

As computer scientists, we know that computers are great at aiding in
repetitive tasks and automation. However, far too often, we forget that 
this applies just as much to our _use_ of the computer as it does to the 
computations we want our programs to perform. We have a vast range of tools
available at our fingertips that enable us to be more productive and
solve more complex problems when working on any computer-related
problem. Yet many of us utilize only a small fraction of those tools; we
only know enough magical incantations by rote to get by, and blindly
copy-paste commands from the internet when we get stuck.

We want to teach you how to make the most of the tools you know, show
you new tools to add to your toolbox, and hopefully instill in you some
excitement for exploring (and perhaps building) more tools on your own.
